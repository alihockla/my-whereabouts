# my-whereabouts
iOS Application

My Whereabouts is a mobile application idea I had in which basically a users whereabouts are tracked and recorded to better retrace if ever needed. The app is currently unfinished but as of right now the user would click a button, "Pin me", that would retrieve the users coordinates and record it in a file along with a timestamp. The end game is for the app to do this automatically without having the user to click any buttons or even open the app.
